## 📖 About The Project
**CPP-library-resource-management-system** is a comprehensive, console-based application designed to automate the core workflows of a modern library. Built as a Term Project, this system leverages **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to ensure modularity, scalability, and robust data management.

The system facilitates seamless interaction between Librarians (Admins) and Members (Students), handling everything from book acquisition to circulation logic and overdue fine calculations. Data persistence is achieved through advanced file handling, ensuring records remain intact between sessions.

### Key Features
* **🔐 Role-Based Access Control:** Secure login portals for Admins and Students.
* **📘 Inventory Management:** Add, update, delete, and modify book records.
* **🔄 Circulation Engine:** Real-time processing of book issues and returns.
* **📅 Automated Fine Calculation:** Logic to track due dates and calculate penalties for late returns.
* **🔎 Advanced Search:** Query books by Title, Author, or Category.
* **💾 Data Persistence:** File handling implementation to store records in `.txt` or `.dat` files.
